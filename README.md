once you click login, if the username and password is correct, it will go to the home because this code in LoginActivity.java
Intent i = new Intent(context, Home.class);

BTW You also need this file mobileLogin.php in the ubuntu moodle folder.file location is (moodle/login/mobileLogin.php)
because i put the file there, It is better to follow the location, if not u will need to edit the url variable in LoginActivity.java 
in the android studio.
the mobileLogin.php is already shared in your google drive, just download it and drag and drop to the location in ubuntu moodle server.

Any question whatsapp in fyp team chat
